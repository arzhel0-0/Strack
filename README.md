# Strack
Welcome to Strack, a heavy-duty Discord bot engineered to micropost count and display message activity within your server. Built upon Python with the use of the discord.py library, Strack affords its server administrators and members the power to track engagements; it counts messages sent by users with particular roles and dynamic leaderboards.
